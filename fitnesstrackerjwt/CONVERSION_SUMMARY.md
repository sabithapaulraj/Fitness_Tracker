# JWT Authentication Conversion Summary

## Overview
This document summarizes the conversion of the fitness tracker application from session-based authentication to JWT-based authentication with role-based access control.

## Major Changes Made

### 1. Dependencies Added (pom.xml)
- **JWT Dependencies**: Added JJWT (Java JWT) library for token generation and validation
  - `jjwt-api`: 0.11.5
  - `jjwt-impl`: 0.11.5 (runtime)
  - `jjwt-jackson`: 0.11.5 (runtime)

### 2. Enhanced User Model
- **Role System**: Added `Role` enum with USER, TRAINER, and ADMIN roles
- **Database Schema**: User table now includes role column

### 3. New Domain Models

#### WorkoutPlan Entity
- Belongs to a trainer (User with TRAINER role)
- Contains exercises
- Includes metadata (created/updated timestamps)

#### Exercise Entity
- Belongs to a workout plan
- Contains sets, reps, rest time, and instructions
- Linked to specific workout plan

### 4. JWT Infrastructure

#### JwtUtil Class
- Generates JWT tokens with user information and roles
- Validates tokens and extracts claims
- Configurable expiration time (24 hours default)
- Secure secret key generation

#### JwtAuthenticationFilter
- Intercepts HTTP requests
- Validates Bearer tokens from Authorization header
- Sets authentication context for valid tokens
- Continues filter chain for public endpoints

### 5. Updated Security Configuration
- **Stateless Sessions**: Disabled session management for JWT
- **CORS Configuration**: Enabled for API access
- **Role-based Authorization**: Different endpoints for different roles
- **JWT Filter Integration**: Added JWT filter before username/password filter

### 6. New API Controllers

#### WorkoutPlanController
- **CRUD Operations**: Create, Read, Update, Delete workout plans
- **Exercise Management**: Add, update, delete exercises within plans
- **Access Control**: Trainers can only access their own plans
- **Security**: Prevents unauthorized plan assignment

#### Enhanced AuthController
- **Dual Authentication**: Both web forms and API endpoints
- **JWT Token Generation**: Returns tokens on successful API login
- **Role-based Registration**: Users can register as trainers or users

### 7. Enhanced Services

#### WorkoutPlanService
- Business logic for workout plan management
- Ownership validation
- CRUD operations with security checks

#### ExerciseService
- Exercise management within workout plans
- Validation of exercise-plan relationships

#### Enhanced CustomUserDetailsService
- Role-based authority assignment
- Support for finding users by email

### 8. Data Transfer Objects (DTOs)
- **LoginRequest/RegisterRequest**: API request structures
- **JwtResponse**: Standardized JWT response format
- **WorkoutPlanRequest/ExerciseRequest**: Structured API requests

### 9. Updated Templates
- **Enhanced UI**: Better styling and user experience
- **Role Information**: Display user roles in dashboard
- **API Information**: Documentation for JWT endpoints

### 10. Database Changes
- **New Tables**: workout_plans, exercises
- **Enhanced User Table**: Added role column
- **Relationships**: Foreign key constraints between entities

## API Endpoints Summary

### Authentication
- `POST /api/auth/api/register` - API user registration
- `POST /api/auth/api/login` - JWT token generation

### Workout Plans (Trainers Only)
- `GET /api/plans` - List trainer's workout plans
- `POST /api/plans` - Create new workout plan
- `GET /api/plans/{id}` - Get specific workout plan
- `PUT /api/plans/{id}` - Update workout plan
- `DELETE /api/plans/{id}` - Delete workout plan

### Exercises (Trainers Only)
- `GET /api/plans/{id}/exercises` - List exercises in plan
- `POST /api/plans/{id}/exercises` - Add exercise to plan
- `PUT /api/plans/{planId}/exercises/{exerciseId}` - Update exercise
- `DELETE /api/plans/{planId}/exercises/{exerciseId}` - Delete exercise

### User Management
- `GET /api/dashboard` - Get dashboard data
- `GET /api/user/api/profile` - Get user profile
- `PUT /api/user/api/profile` - Update user profile

## Security Implementation

### Role-Based Access Control
1. **TRAINER Role**:
   - Can create, read, update, delete workout plans
   - Can manage exercises within their plans
   - Cannot assign plans to users

2. **USER Role**:
   - Can access profile and dashboard
   - Cannot create workout plans
   - Cannot be assigned plans by trainers

3. **ADMIN Role**:
   - Ready for future implementation
   - Can potentially assign plans to users

### Authorization Flow
1. User registers with chosen role
2. User logs in via API and receives JWT token
3. Token includes role information
4. Each API request validates token and checks role permissions
5. Unauthorized access returns HTTP 403 Forbidden

### Security Features
- **Ownership Validation**: Trainers can only access their own plans
- **Token Expiration**: JWT tokens expire after 24 hours
- **Secure Headers**: CORS and authentication headers properly configured
- **Input Validation**: DTOs ensure proper request structure

## Backward Compatibility
- **Web Interface**: Traditional login/session still works
- **Existing URLs**: All original endpoints maintained
- **Database Migration**: Automatic schema updates via Hibernate

## Testing
- **Comprehensive Test Script**: PowerShell script tests all major functionality
- **Manual Testing**: Web interface remains functional
- **API Documentation**: Complete REST API documentation provided

## Deployment Considerations
- **Database Update**: New database schema will be created automatically
- **Environment Variables**: JWT secret can be externalized
- **CORS Configuration**: May need adjustment for production domains

## Future Enhancements Ready
- Admin role implementation for user assignments
- Workout plan sharing and templates
- Progress tracking integration
- Mobile app JWT integration

## Compliance with Requirements

✅ **JWT-based Authentication**: Fully implemented
✅ **Role-based Access Control**: TRAINER and USER roles working
✅ **CRUD Operations**: Complete workout plan and exercise management
✅ **Security Restrictions**: Trainers cannot assign plans to users
✅ **RESTful API Design**: All endpoints follow REST conventions
✅ **Working Project**: All URLs and redirects function correctly
